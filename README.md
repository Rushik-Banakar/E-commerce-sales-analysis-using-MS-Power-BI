# E-commerce-sales-analysis-using-MS-Power-BI
Developed an E-commerce sales analysis dashboard using visualizations like stacked column charts, pie charts, funnel charts, donut charts, tree maps, and cards. I analyzed sales data by category, market, ship mode, country, and state. I also used slicers for interactive filtering by category and market

For my recent data analysis project, I utilized Power BI to provide comprehensive insights into E-commerce sales analysis dashboard. The project began with the integration of a substantial dataset, comprising 51,291 entries and 24 distinct categories, imported from Excel into Power BI Desktop. This initial step was crucial in ensuring that the data was accurate and ready for analysis, reflecting my attention to detail and ability to manage large data sets effectively.

Once the data was imported, I employed a variety of Power BI's visualization tools to extract meaningful insights and present them in an accessible format. A stacked column chart was used to analyze sales by category, allowing for a clear comparison across different product lines. To understand the distribution of sales across various markets, I used a pie chart, which provided a visual breakdown of market performance. Additionally, a funnel chart was employed to assess sales by ship mode, highlighting the efficiency and popularity of different shipping methods. For a geographical perspective, a donut chart was used to analyze sales by country, while a tree map provided a detailed view of sales by state. These visualizations not only made complex data more understandable but also highlighted key trends and patterns in the sales data.

To further enhance the dashboard's functionality, I incorporated four cards that displayed essential metrics: the sum of sales, profit, quantity, and shipping cost. These cards offered a quick snapshot of the store's overall performance, making it easier for stakeholders to grasp critical information at a glance. To improve user interaction and data exploration, I added slicers for category and market. This feature allowed users to filter data dynamically, providing a more tailored and interactive experience.

Overall, this project showcases my ability to handle extensive datasets, utilize advanced data visualization techniques, and create interactive dashboards that deliver valuable business insights. My proficiency in Power BI, combined with my analytical skills, positions me well for a data analyst role, where transforming raw data into actionable insights is key.
